1. Syntax Overview:
   make [option] [target]
   make requires a makefile, if its not named makefile nor Makefile, use -f option
   target is a tag (name defined) in makefile

2. Basic Syntax
   target: file	 file2 file3 ... fileN
   <tab> command1
   <tab> command2
   <tab> ...
   <tab> commandN


target --> the output file
file1-fileN --> dependency list
command1-commandN --> rules

Notice: order matters!
make will not read the next target if it is not in the dependecy list
